# **Wine Classification with Machine Learning Models**

## **Project Description**
This project aims to classify breast cancer tumors as **malignant** (cancerous) or **benign** (non-cancerous) using a variety of **machine learning models**. The dataset used for this project is the [Wine recognition dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_wine.html#sklearn.datasets.load_wine) from [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html). The purpose of this project is to train and compare the performance of various classification algorithms in predicting wine types on the load_wine dataset. By training [Decision Tree](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html#sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier), [Random Forest](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html), [Na√Øve Bayes](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/naive_bayes.html), and [K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier.html) models.

## **Goals**
The main goals of this project are:
1. **Compare the performance of different models** by evaluating accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports, we can determine which model is the most accurate for classification.
2. **Identify the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm**. Does the model have high complexity and lead to overfitting? Is the model too simple and results in underfitting?
3. **Develop skills in data processing and analysis** from loading data and splitting datasets to training models and evaluating performance using various metrics.
4. **Help choose the best model for real-world classification tasks** whether for spam detection, medical diagnosis, or facial recognition, these experiments provide insights into selecting the most suitable model.
